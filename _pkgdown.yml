    The youdrawitR package provides functions for creating interactive you-draw-it plots. Users can generate data using customDataGen 
    or linearDataGen and then utilize the drawr function to create interactive graphics for exploration and testing. Additionally, this 
    package provides a shiny app alongside the functions and information on this can be found in the shiny-app-info article.
